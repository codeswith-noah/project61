        <p>My hobby is wierd. It's not specific. Most kids might say sports, gaming, but I say creation. It doesn't matter what I create. It's just the fun of it. I do like playing video games, but, I like making them more. And, creation can be a ton of different things. It could be crating a mental image in your mind, or it could be painting a picture, it could be anything really. I don't care. All that matters, Is that I enjoy it. Creation, is not one thing. It's many. That's what I like about it. That's my hobby. </p>
